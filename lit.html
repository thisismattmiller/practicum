					<h3>We Are All Digital Humanists Now - Geoffrey Little</h3>
                    <p>I selected this article because it concisely speaks to where I feel Information/Library science should be heading: The transition into content creation and curation as an aspect of information management.  Little discusses the recent developments in the digital humanities and the rise of using technology to better understand collections including "computing, textual analysis, digitization, data visualization, and geo-spatial mapping techniques."<br><br> Little, G. (2011). We Are All Digital Humanists Now. The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 37(4), 352-354. doi:10.1016/j.acalib.2011.04.023</p>

					<h3>Location, Location, (Geospatial) Location - Nancy Davis Kho</h3>
                    <p>Kho provides a good introduction to geolocation for the uninitiated. Documenting the origins of the technology and possibilities they hold. While not specifically tied to digital collections Kho emphasizes how this emerging technology has the power to improve many areas and markets.

					<h3>Finding Yourself at the Intersection of Location and Content â€“ Ron Miller</h3>
                    <p>Miller looks at taking geo-spatial location and tying it with content. While that obviously makes sense Miller looks at it from many of the commercial and social networks available. Relating content to location if even only for social media purposes is interesting because it also relates to using geolocation for presenting collections. It improves access and generates interest in the collection. The same reasons to use geolocation with social media can be applied to why we would use it to present collections.

					<h3>Your Reality, Augmented - Meredith Farkas</h3>
                    <p>Augmented reality is a technology closely tied to geolocation it is the process of contributing useful data to your geo-spatial experience. For example if you were standing in front of a historical monument you could use your smart phone to overlay a historic image of the area. While I'm not personally totally convinced of the usefulness of the technology in its current form it is interesting to see how it develops and what role it can play in presenting digital collections.

					<h3>Implementing Mobile Augmented Reality Applications for Cultural Institutions - Boyer &amp; Marcus</h3>
                    <p>The City of Philadelphia created a large project called PhillyHistory.org which used mobile technology and geolocation to map historic images of the city to geo-spatial points on digital maps.  The article details technical aspects of the project as well as the hurdles they had to overcome during the project. The paper provides a very interesting look into the process and presents what I feel so far is the best use of geolocation in a digital archive so far.
